# Simbian

This project implements a responsive, animated dashboard for the Simbian security, showcasing "Without Simbian" and "With Simbian" modes. 
The thought process focused on creating reusable, scalable components with dynamic data handling, leveraging separate data files for configurability. The UI transitions smoothly between modes using Framer Motion for animations, with features like alert counters, card layouts, and a step-by-step horizontal flow. 

Tailwind CSS ensures responsive design, and `twMerge` handles class overrides for flexibility.

### Animation Library: 

Framer Motion is used for all animations, including card entrances, alert transitions, and layout shifts, providing smooth, performant effects.
